# Mapping_Earthquakes
## Project Overview:
In this project, we built interactive data visualizations on earthquakes worldwide for the last seven days using the latest earthquake GeoJSON data from the U.S. Geological Survey website. We retrieved the earthquake data using JavaScript and the D3 and leaflet libraries and plotted the data on a Mapbox map through an API request.
On the map, the diameter of the popup markers for each earthquake reflects the magnitude in size and color; the fault lines show the relationship between the location, frequency of seismic activity and tectonic plates. The map provides the options to view the map in three different styles (Street View, Satellite View, and Dark View). 


## Results:
#### Deliverable 1: Map of Earthquakes in relation to the tectonic plates (Street View and Satellite View)
